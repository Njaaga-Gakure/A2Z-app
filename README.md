We'll use Airtables to store our products data, and Netlify serverless functions to retrieve the data.
 
On the frontend, we intend to display a Home page containing a hero component, a featured products component, and a services offered component. 
Page 2 will be an About page that contains company info. 
We'll also have a products page that lists our products, either in list view or grid view. On this page, we'll add a sort functionality, by price and name, ascending or descending. We'll also have a functionality that allows filtering by brand name, color, or price. From this page, you can navigate to the single product page that contains the nitty gritty of each product, as well as an add to cart button.

Naturally, we'll have a cart page, where you can view all pending orders/products chosen. This will include the price of each item, and the total price of your order. To proceed to checkout, however, you'll need to sign in first. Alternatively, you can clear cart using the button we'll provide.
